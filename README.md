## Introduction: 
The game Pictionary is an interactive drawing game. The rules of this game are amazingly simple. A game consists of custom number of rounds where someone must draw an offered word and the others must guess it. If someone guesses the word correctly, the player gets one point. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.

## High-level components

[GameController](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-27/Pictionary-Server/blob/master/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs22/controller/GameController.java)
The game controller is critical to the app's functionality because it handles practically all API requests performed during the game. It, for example, manages the game's capacity. It determines if a game is already full or whether a user can join.

[UserController](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-27/Pictionary-Server/blob/master/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs22/controller/UserController.java)
Almost all API calls involving the user are handled by the user controller. It, for example, manages the api calls during the user registration procedure.

[UserService](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-27/Pictionary-Server/blob/master/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs22/service/UserService.java) 
The user service is in charge of a wide range of functions. It, for example, checks whether the user's email address already exists and sends an error message if it does.

## API Endpoint Testing

### Postman

-   We highly recommend to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) in order to test your API Endpoints.

## Roadmap

- Add a different game mode where the users can play some kind of drinking game.
- Create shapes which could be used by drag & drop during drawing.
- Make the application more secure.
